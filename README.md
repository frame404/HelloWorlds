Initial Code Repository - Course Progress

<h1>Initial Code Repository - Course Progress</h1>

<p>This repository aims to showcase my progress in courses and projects by sharing initial code snippets. Here you will find a collection of small scripts and programs that I have explored during my programming journey.</p>

<p>The codes in this repository serve as practical examples of concepts and techniques that I have learned in courses and tutorials. They reflect my initial steps in programming and demonstrate the progress I have made over time.</p>
